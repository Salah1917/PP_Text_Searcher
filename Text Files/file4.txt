So of course Joey DeVilla the Accordion Guy finds this really upsetting He cant believe it He corresponds more with his informant whom he refers to as Whistleblower She seems reasonable and for real and what she says is plausible Joey calls the Web company where New Girl had said she worked Nobody there has ever heard of her

Accordion Guy comes to think Whistleblower might be right But he has to know he has to confront New Girl and be sure So he lays everything out for her She protests that hes got it all wrong shes telling the truth about everything for instance about being a computer programmer with a computer science degree

So heres what Joey DeVilla does he pulls this trick he remembers from an old episode of Columbo Here is the conversation as he presents it in the post where he tells this story

Me So you really did graduate from computer engineering
New Girl Yes I did
Me And you took the Algorithms course
New Girl Of course
Me And you have all the papers you wrote
New Girl Yes I kept them all and Ill show them to you tomorrow
Me I want to see the one we always called the Hell Paper the mandatory fourthyear paper You know the one where we prove that P NP
New Girl I did that I proved P NP
Me Gotcha

So Accordion Guy sadly concludes that his Whistleblower was right And he says goodbye to his New Girl End of story

So lets start looking at this list of criticisms of blogging and the Web using Joey DeVillas story as sort of a lens Now the standard take on trust and the Internet is dont trust anything you read on the Internet right Its a cesspool of lies Nobody is who they say they are

But now lets look at this from where Accordion Guy is sitting This person he met in the real world this person he was having a relationship with turned out to be a serial liar And this anonymous whistleblower who contacted him out of the blue on the Internet through his blog turns out to be telling the truth

This is just one anecdote of course and as they say the plural of anecdote is not fact Still if you spend a lot of time out there reading blogs and listening to the stories of the people who write them you do begin to see a pattern it turns out that there is very little correlation between whether you are online or offline and whether you are telling the truth or lying It also turns out that people who share their stories in public frequently find that they create a bond with their readers They expose vulnerabilities to the world Doing this can invite assault and produce wounds But it can also invite support and produce growth

This problem of trust online comes up not just in personal relations but also in public life People sometimes say that the rise of blogging means a breakdown in authority If anyone can say anything and everyone is saying everything how do we recognize the truth How do we know who we can trust

Id argue that its not a breakdown in authority so much as a change in how we grant that authority In this new media environment institutions have relatively less sway Individual voices have more impact

I know that people worry about the spread of misinformation and lies on the Web And plainly this is a real problem But how exactly does this stuff spread Right now Id argue the allnews cable channels are far more powerful and efficient than the Web is in propagating lies or truthiness And the worst failures in our media system occur at the faultlines between new media and old media when broadcast outlets start behaving like little websites Or when cable channels with huge audiences decide that its OK to repeat some lie because hey theyre just quoting something somebody said on a blog The bigger your megaphone the greater your responsibility

We also have to accept that sadly gossip and gullibility are parts of human nature You might know Winston Churchills famous line A lie is halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its boots on And that was decades before the Web right What the Web does mean is that today at least the truth can have a lot more boots on the ground

Im an optimist about the power of open expression on the Web to sort truth from lies over time There are sites and services that help this process like Snopescom and Politifact and even Wikipedia Of course theyre imperfect But they rely on good open processes that are as trustworthy in their own way as the traditional newsroom approach

150 years ago in On Liberty John Stuart Mill wrote about how we obtain a clearer perception and livelier impression of truth from its collision with error We all get disturbed and outraged sometimes at the sheer noise level of Internetstyle debate But the next time you do I think you can take heart That noise is the sound of truths collision with error

Mill urged us to be willing to throw ourselves into the mental position of those who think differently from us to challenge our beliefs by tossing them in the ring This is what we should do every time we sit down to write And its one key to improving the balance of truth and lies in our own information diets Remember that on the Web we all gravitate toward the writers we agree with but were also never more than a link or a click away from those we disagree with

Another frequent complaint about the writing we do on the Web is that so much of it is anonymous Ill put it to you that this complaint is overstated There are anonymous blogs and websites but they are a relative minority Sometimes bloggers will try to hide their identities because they want to tell stories about their workplaces without losing their jobs or blow the whistle on some institution without risking their necks But these are rare cases And even when bloggers are anonymous the more successful they are the less successful theyre going to be at staying anonymous So the guy who began writing about what its like to be a waiter at WaiterRant kept his name a secret for a few years But the more popular he got the more inevitable it was that we would learn who this waiter was and where he worked

In a similar vein to complaints about anonymity we hear a lot about the awful manners people display online The lack of courtesy the nastiness the juvenility the anger And you do see this But you dont see it everywhere Id suggest that you see it mostly in spaces that combine two characteristics high traffic and low rules enforcement The comments spaces on most news sites perfectly combine these traits which is why their discussions are so often so awful

The thing is the Web didnt suddenly produce an explosion of creepy rude people They were always there They just didnt have a place to strut their rudeness in public The answer here is to create spaces that have hosts who set the tone for visitors and enforce community standards the same standards that keep those rude people in line in the physical world

If visitors to your discussions see that real people are having real conversations they are much more likely to do the same If you look at the comments on Accordion Guys story thats what you see Theres a big contrast between the kind of interested thoughtful responses so many bloggers get from their readers and the kind of driveby stupidity that most professional news sites get from theirs I think that explains why these two groups have such different understandings of the quality of online discourse

The next criticism I want to look at is the idea that the web eliminates serendipity The medium makes it harder to stumble on interesting stuff to read that we didnt know about This is often the lament of people who love paper magazines and newspapers They miss the way your eye might land on a catchy headline or photo that might lead you to read something you didnt know you were interested in I have to confess Ive never understood this complaint I love paper too But the Web is like one great serendipity machine

Havent we all had that experience of starting to look something up you know like the lyrics to White Christmas then realizing that an entire hour has passed and somehow weve ended up on the Wikipedia article about black holes Blogs are especially amazing at generating serendipity If you follow good bloggers youre putting yourself in the hands of these writers without necessarily knowing what kind of thing theyre going to toss at you next And if youre the writer you never know what youre going to hear back from the Web Look at what landed in Accordion Guys inbox Couldnt have been more relevant more useful or more unexpected to himSo of course Joey DeVilla the Accordion Guy finds this really upsetting He cant believe it He corresponds more with his informant whom he refers to as Whistleblower She seems reasonable and for real and what she says is plausible Joey calls the Web company where New Girl had said she worked Nobody there has ever heard of her
