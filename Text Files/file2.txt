I chose the title because it seems to touch on so much of what is exciting and what is threatening too about blogging and all the other changes that we call collectively the digital revolution Say everything the phrase suggests the thrill of the universal project the Web sometimes seems to be in which everyone gets to contribute to a vast collective conversation and pool of knowledge Say everything also raises all kinds of questions about this new world If we say everything how will we have time to listen And Arent some things better left unsaid So these are some of the things I am going to look at today

Now a little about the book itself SAY EVERYTHING tells the story of blogging Where did this thing come from Who got it going and what were their stories So it is a kind of contemporary history I get two reactions when I say that One group of people in the technology industry thinks blogging is now old hat It is over They will say Blogging That is SO nineteen ninety nine They have already moved on The other group which I think is bigger than the first group says History Blogging What history It is so new

In fact blogging by that name is now a decade old and websites that were really blogs in all but name have been around since roughly the mid nineteen nineties There is a lot of history a lot of stories tales of what happens when people get the chance to say everything they want to in public I think these stories have a lot to teach us about how to navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of life online

The culture of Silicon Valley the tech industry and the Web tends to have a very short memory And even though the story of how blogging began is a recent one it is not that well known I wrote Say Everything because I thought it would be good to get this story down while it is still fresh And I was lucky I had watched a lot of it first hand

I built my first website in nineteen ninety four And I want to take you back to those days the early days of the Web Have any of you seen a video that was circulating a while back called Medieval Help Desk Look it up when you have a chance This is the one where the medieval monk in Scandinavia is freaked out about this new thing called a book He is used to scrolls Books are a weird new interface He has to ask a helpdesk guy to explain to him how to open it how to turn pages and so on He is afraid the text will disappear when he closes the covers

It is a reminder that every technology we take for granted today was once forbidding and unfamiliar The Web was the same way at first

So back then I was the technology editor at Salon com My job was to find and assign stories about the Web and computing We needed one story a week at first later we really cranked it up to one story a day We would take that story and edit it and illustrate it and publish it with a certain amount of loving care And people liked it we did good work but we could only do so much

There were a bunch of other websites that I found myself returning to over and over during the course of my day Because every time I returned to them they seemed to have something new These sites did not put a lot of time and effort into each story In fact they did not really publish stories they posted items Some of these sites were produced by professionals others were one man shows amateur efforts They all shared some traits they tended to be written in a casual personal voice they linked a lot And they did not have a lead story or top story Each time they posted something new it went at the top of the page

Now I was an editor I spent lots of time in meetings that were held for the purpose of deciding what goes on top of the page And here these sites were saying Go home We do not need you to do that So this was a little distressing to me as an editor

And yet I kept going back to these sites They worked They got news out fast And they were easy to use What these early bloggers had discovered was a way of organizing writing that was native to the Web It made such sense that it took off It was not an import from print or broadcasting It was discovered by outsiders who fell in love with the Web and what it could do
