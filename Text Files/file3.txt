SAY EVERYTHING tells some of their stories So let me get a reading How many of you read blogs How many write a blog

To answer these questions you probably had to pause and ask What exactly is a blog We do not have a formal definition do we The usual definition of blog is A personal website where the newest material goes on top often with lots of links to other sites That definition is pretty neutral It describes a form

But blogging was also the embodiment of a vision The idea that the web should be two way that we should be writing it as well as reading it The spread of blogging represented the first time this idea of a two way web got implemented on a really large scale That is why I think the story of blogging is worth our time as we see our culture filling up with ever more efficient variations on this idea led by Facebook and Twitter and multiplying on all these ever smaller and more versatile little devices that we carry in our pockets

In SAY EVERYTHING I tried to sort of follow a spark that started among software developers and then spread to upstart journalists and political writers and concerned citizens and then out into the business world and pop culture and beyond This spark carried the ideas of blogging into wider and wider circles of society Let us look at what those ideas were

The first idea is self expression Blogs are usually written in the first person and they are most often autobiographical This is not in itself revolutionary The ideal of self expression is not some late twentieth century innovation It has a long pedigree I think of Walt Whitmans Song of Myself the essays of Montaigne the diaries of Samuel Pepys The confessions of St Augustine

The difference today is that the opportunity is much more widely available to express yourself in public In the early days of the web people began to realize this One of those people was a guy named Justin Hall whose story opens my book

He was a student at Swarthmore in the mid nineteen nineties who told the story of his life as he lived it every day on the Web then discovered the limits of that way of being His tale is instructive for all of us in the Facebook age Justin found that tempting as it is to try to say everything it can really mess up your life For any of us to say everything about our life is not really possible and probably is not a good idea

The second idea at the heart of blogging is novelty With a blog the new stuff goes on top This appeals to our innate sensory makeup Our brains are finely tuned to sense what is new in our environment If a cat walked across this stage over there and this has happened to me you would stop paying any attention to me The cat would be the new thing here Blogs feed that

This is also a temptation of course It can lead us toward superficiality We can find ourselves skimming the surface of the present And neglecting the timeless

This does not worry me as much as it might Because the Web has a beautiful duality at its heart The stuff we post online is often ephemeral of the moment but it is also archival It has a staying power that our spoken words do not However casual our online writing may be it is still writing

This brings me to the third idea at the heart of blogging which is linking connection Links are pretty mundane they just take you from one page to another right But links also represent paths of our attention The links that bloggers put into their posts leave trails of meaning These trails tell us what is of note and lasting value in the vast pile of stuff we are accumulating online They sort out the present and leave a record for the future Their value can be really simple like helping you find something you want to reread They also provide usable data for programs and services that can mine unexpected meaning from our collective writing output That is how Google built what is still the most valuable tool for finding anything on the Web

So we have self expression Novelty And links Put that all together and you get a picture of what kind of writing blogging is Personal immediate and connected If you understand that you can see why it has become so popular even though so many of us looked at it at first and thought what is the big deal

Once it became popular blogging also became the target of a series of criticisms about subjects like trust and truth anonymity and civility narcissism and shallowness overload and addiction These criticisms are worth spending some time on They are proxies of a sort for the larger debate we are all having today over the role of the Internet in our society and whether it is a force for good or ill

I want to begin here with a story it is about a blogger named Joey deVilla who calls himself Accordion Guy Cause he plays an accordion And it is a story that did not make it into Say Everything so you can think of this as a kind of bonus track

Now to understand this story you need to know one thing in advance If you study computer science you know it already There is this problem in computer science called P equals NP Does not matter right now what it is What is important is nobody can prove that P equals NP If you could prove it you would get a million dollar prize Has not happened yet It is an unsolved problem

Anyway here is the story Joey DeVilla is a computer programmer and blogger who plays an accordion In two thousand three he wrote a long post about a very strange situation He had started dating someone he called the New Girl and begun writing about his excitement at this new relationship He even wrote a post on Ten cool things about the New Girl Then he gets an email telling him Stop You do not know this person I do Everything she tells you about her life including a lot of those ten cool things is a lie She is pathological She has left behind a long line of people she has taken advantage of Beware
