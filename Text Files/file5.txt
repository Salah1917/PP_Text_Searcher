But its silly to fail to see how a great blog can also offer a comparable experience When you commit to reading a blog you hand your time and attention over to the blogger You agree to let the bloggers voice fill your head A blog is timed differently and delivered differently but the experience of connection with a writer is similar There are some important contrasts An edited book is a more carefully assembled product A blog is more timely and more porous to other voices But a blog can be as deep as its writer chooses to make it

In todays news media in fact its the bloggers who are providing us with the most substance If you want to understand the really complex issues we face the science of climate change or the debate over healthcare reform or the dreadful mess of our financial system or any other problem thats just too intricate to be explained in a news story or short broadcast its the bloggers who specialize in these topics who will fill the cup of your curiosity

They will in fact overflow it if you let them Which brings me to the last and I think most difficult problem that people raise with the phenomenon of blogging Theres just so much of it Millions of people saying everything How do we keep from feeling overwhelmed How do we possibly keep up

When people ask me that the first thing I say is Dont try Dont try to keep up Do you feel obligated to keep up with all the books that are published each year There are thousands and thousands Do you try to see all the movies released each year Do you go through life thinking my god there are 7 billion people on the planet Im never going to be able to meet them all No We accept that our lives are a limited span of time And we allocate that time to our family our friends our needs and our passions

The same logic applies to the explosion of writing and reading that blogging represents No one can possibly encompass it all I spent years writing a book on it but I barely nicked the surface of whats out there The answer is not to push ourselves to become ever more efficient information processing machines Instead Id argue we should consider feeling grateful to have this problem Because when we complain about information overload what were really saying is Theres more stuff that I want to read than I have time to read Which is a great problem to have

So one way of talking about this situation is to use words like overload another is to use words like abundance its the same glass half empty or half full I was talking recently with an old friend who is a professional book critic And she said You know its a lot harder to find readers today than writers

Theres some truth in this and its worth thinking about But its also not as dire as it sounds Because I believe that even if you never end up with more than a handful of readers writing in public can be its own reward And I think thats why so many people take up blogging even when they know theyre never going to get famous or make a lot of money doing it

Writing for other people is one of the best ways there is to know our own minds This is really who we are when we are on writing We are more ourselves When I worked as a theater critic people would often come up to me after a show and say whatd you think And Id always have to say gee sorry I dont know yet Wait till Ive written my piece Then Ill know

When I was thinking about what I was going to say today I ended up doing what I always do I sat down and wrote a post working through some ideas about just why the experience of writing in public can be so valuable So if I may let me read you just a little bit of it give you the flavor Heres what I wrote

Learning to make things changes how we understand and consume those things When I started reporting the news as a teenager I read the newspaper differently When I learned to play guitar in my 20s I listened to songs differently When I first played around with desktop video editing 15 years ago I began watching movies and TV differently Its the same with writing Learning how to write changes how we read and how we think

Then I quoted a passage from Maryanne Wolfs excellent book about reading and the brain Proust and the Squid in which she describes the work of a psychologist named Lev Vygotsky Vygotskys research showed that the very process of writing ones thoughts leads individuals to refine those thoughts and to discover new ways of thinking

Now writing for an audience is a special and important case its writing with feedback and consequences The word empowerment describes a part of that change writing is a way of discovering ones voice and feeling its strength But writing in public involves discovering the boundaries and limits of that power too We learn all the different ways in which we are not the center of the universe That kind of discovery has a way of helping us grow up fast

So when I hear the still commonplace dismissal of blogging as a trivial pastime or an amateurish hobby I think hold on a second Writing making texts changes how we read and think Every blogger is someone who has learned to read the world differently by writing for the world The person who has struggled to turn a thought into a blog post and then seen how that post has been reflected back by readers and other bloggers is someone who can think more creatively about how sharing might work at other scales and in other contexts A mind that has changed is more likely to imagine a world that can change

One way to assess the impact of blogging is to say that the number of people who have had the experience of writing in public has skyrocketed over the course of the last decade Lets say that pre Internet the universe of people with experience writing in public journalists authors scholars was perhaps 100000 people And lets say that of the hundreds of millions of blogs reported to date maybe 10 million of them are sustained enough efforts for us to say that their authors have gained real experience writing in public Im pulling these numbers out of a hat trying to err on the conservative side We still get an expansion of a hundredfold

In about a decade then weve expanded the number of people whove experienced writing in public by something like a factor of 100 Today for way more of us than ever before writing for one another is a regular part of our existence With all the problems and the questions that new technologies raise I still find this an incredibly hopeful development Im amazed and delighted that its happened in my lifetime And I cant wait to see what comes next from this vast and still growing community of keyboards Even or especially if it comes in the form of large blocks of uninterrupted textBut its silly to fail to see how a great blog can also offer a comparable experience When you commit to reading a blog you hand your time and attention over to the blogger You agree to let the bloggers voice fill your head A blog is timed differently and delivered differently but the experience of connection with a writer is similar There are some important contrasts An edited book is a more carefully assembled product A blog is more timely and more porous to other voices But a blog can be as deep as its writer chooses to make it
