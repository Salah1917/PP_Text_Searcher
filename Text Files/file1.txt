I want to start with a story from The Onion Because really shouldnt every talk start with a story from The Onion This is from earlier this year  

The headline reads Nation Shudders At Large Block Of Uninterrupted Text  

Unable to rest their eyes on a colorful photograph or boldface heading that could be easily skimmed and forgotten Americans collectively recoiled Monday when confronted with a solid block of uninterrupted text  

Dumbfounded citizens from Maine to California gazed helplessly at the frightening chunk of print unsure of what to do next  

Without an illustration chart or embedded YouTube video to ease them in millions were frozen in place terrified by the sight of one long unbroken string of English words  

It demands so much of my time and concentration said Chicago resident Dale Huza who was confronted by the confusing mound of words early Monday afternoon This large block of text it expects me to figure everything out on my own and I hate it  

This is a sign of how rough the outlook sometimes seems for our culture of reading and writing  

In fact every generation fears the death of literacy at the hands of some new media technology And yet I am here to share some optimism After long existence as a confirmed cynic who shared the general belief in our imminent cultural doom I felt an unfamiliar sensation fifteen years ago when the Internet came over the horizon I found myself becoming excited and hopeful  

When I looked at the Internet I saw a medium that involves a huge amount of reading Sure a lot of it is presented in a highly decorated or distracting form But a lot of it is in large blocks of uninterrupted text too  

And there is something even more significant The Web is not just inspiring a lot of reading It has also opened the opportunity for a stunning amount of new writing  

When I was growing up in the nineteen sixties and seventies the chief fear on behalf of literary culture was that television was going to destroy it What if we were becoming a nation of passive glassy eyed couch potatoes mindless consumers of numbing video entertainment  

To some extent that happened Yet we survived And then something came along that challenged television The Web was a two way medium Each consumer was also a potential creator or contributor in a way that never happened could not happen with television That is a huge transformation of our media landscape and we are still just getting our heads around it  

So this is the National Day on Writing I confess I did not know there was such a thing until I got this invitation I am delighted there is But it is an odd construction Day on Writing It sort of sounds like those old ads that went This is your brain on drugs  

Think about it What is your brain on writing or even our world on writing That is what I am going to talk about today  

So this Day on Writing is a great thing I admit when I first heard it I thought it was Day of Writing You know What are we doing here We should all be writing right now Of course the only way to be a writer is to write frequently regularly ideally daily  

You could always do this long before there was any such thing as a blog You could keep a diary or a notebook or a commonplace book But you could not do it in public for an audience Now pretty much anyone can do that And that has changed our world in some big ways some welcome some distressing  

When I titled my book Say Everything I do not think I realized quite what I was getting into It turns out to be a really interesting title  

First of all I promise I will not even attempt to say everything myself today I will talk for maybe thirty or thirty five minutes and then open it up for more of a conversation which is very much the spirit of this topic anyway  

Pretty soon after I started working on this book I realized that the title was sort of a taunt to myself Say everything Saying everything is a writers dream It is what you think you will get to do when you write a book Get it all between covers Then you learn that a book ends up feeling really short And you never get to say more than a fraction of what you want  

The title also turned out to be problematic because everyone from my first radio interviewer on gets it wrong They say Say Anything So do not worry about it if you do too I do not mind it is OK I am used to it But my advice is do not give your book a title that is just a little different from a popular old movies name
